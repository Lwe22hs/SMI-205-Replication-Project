## Project Overview

Ruedin paper (2020) examines how individuals in Europe are uneasy and feel threatened by immigration. Respondents consistently regard immigrants from other cultures and those more likely to get social benefits as more dangerous.The findings that Didier claimed was the fact that older people are prone to display a more negative view towards immigrants. Given my lack of comprehension on the reason he had made this assertion along with lack of clarification I was interested in investigating this specific claim to determine if what he claimed was accurate or not. Lack of reasons forced me to look up different perspectives on this particular claim and what other researchers had discovered.

## Objective

-*Original study*: Ruedin, D. (2020). Do we need multiple questions to capture feeling threatened by immigrants?. Political Research Exchange, 2(1), 1758576.

-*Hypothesis*: The original replication projected just stated the claim where older people have a negative view on immigration and there wasn't any explanation why that claim was made.I am hoping to prove it as an actual relation

## Data Preparation

-*Data Cleaning*- by subsetting the key variables,(f2_1", "f2_2", "f2_3", "f2_4", "f2_5", "f2_6", "f2_7", "f2_8", "f2_9", "f2_10", "f2_11", "f2_12", "f2_13", "f2_14", "f2_15, edu,mcp,age,fear, ideology, sex, active) into a new dataset

-*variables*
   -*Dependant Variable* - Value(Fear)
   -*Independant Variable* -
         1. *Main* - Edu - Education level
                   - Age - Age
         2. *Moderating Variables* - Fear
                                   - Ideology (political ideology)
                                   - sex (female)
                                   - Active (employment status)
